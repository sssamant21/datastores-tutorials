------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Objective

Caching becomes difficult when authoritative data changes.

Reading from Redis is simple:

``` text
GET key
```

The harder question is:

> What should happen to the cached value when the source of truth
> changes?

Incorrect invalidation can produce:

``` text
stale data
lost freshness
race conditions
out-of-order cache writes
persistent old values
unnecessary source load
cross-instance inconsistency
```

This chapter builds on Chapter 12's cache-aside pattern and focuses
specifically on cache consistency.

By the end, you should be able to:

-   Compare cache deletion with cache updating.
-   Explain source-first write ordering.
-   Identify invalidation failure windows.
-   Explain stale-repopulation races.
-   Understand delayed second invalidation as a mitigation pattern.
-   Use source versions or timestamps to prevent older data from
    overwriting newer cached state.
-   Design event-driven invalidation.
-   Understand CDC-driven cache invalidation.
-   Handle duplicate and out-of-order events.
-   Design idempotent invalidation consumers.
-   Reason about consistency guarantees.
-   Monitor invalidation health.
-   Troubleshoot stale-cache incidents.
-   Build production invalidation runbooks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Source of Truth

For classic cache-aside:

``` text
Authoritative Store
       |
       v
Application
       |
       v
Redis Cache
```

The authoritative store might be:

``` text
PostgreSQL
MongoDB
MySQL
API/service
document store
another durable system
```

Redis is the performance layer.

The cache must eventually reflect authoritative state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. The Core Problem

Assume Redis contains:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "status": "active"
}
```

The source is updated to:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "status": "inactive"
}
```

Redis still contains:

``` text
active
```

until one of these occurs:

``` text
explicit invalidation
cache update
TTL expiration
version change
event-driven refresh
```

The consistency design determines how long the mismatch can exist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 1 --- Strategy: Delete the Cache

## 4. Source Update Then Delete

Common cache-aside pattern:

``` text
1. Update source.
2. Commit succeeds.
3. Delete/invalidate cache key.
4. Next read misses.
5. Next read reloads source.
```

Conceptually:

``` text
Application
    |
    +----> Source UPDATE
    |         |
    |       success
    |
    +----> Redis UNLINK/DEL
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Why Deletion Is Attractive

Deleting avoids maintaining two representations during the write.

You do not need to guarantee:

``` text
source update format
==
cache serialization format
```

during the write transaction.

The next read reconstructs cache state from the authoritative source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2 --- Strategy: Update the Cache

## 6. Dual Update

Alternative:

``` text
1. Update source.
2. Update Redis.
```

This can reduce the next-read miss.

But now the application must keep:

``` text
source
cache
```

synchronized across separate systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Dual-Write Failure

Timeline:

``` text
T1 source update succeeds
T2 Redis update fails
```

Result:

``` text
source = new
cache  = old
```

TTL may eventually repair it, but consistency is temporarily broken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Reverse Failure

If code does:

``` text
Redis update
then source update
```

and the source update fails:

``` text
cache = value that never became authoritative
```

This is usually worse.

For cache-aside, source-first ordering is the safer baseline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 3 --- Strategy Comparison

## 9. Delete vs Update

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Strategy                Advantage               Risk
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Source then delete      Simple correctness      Next read misses
  cache                   model                   

  Source then update      Avoids next miss        Dual-write consistency
  cache                                           

  Cache then source       Fast cache change       Cache may represent
                                                  failed source write

  TTL only                Very simple             Staleness lasts until
                                                  expiration
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

A production design may combine:

``` text
source update
+
cache invalidation
+
TTL safety net
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 4 --- Write Ordering

## 10. Why Ordering Matters

Operations across:

``` text
database
Redis
```

are usually not one atomic transaction.

Therefore every ordering creates a failure window.

You must understand the window rather than pretending it does not exist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Recommended Baseline

For cache-aside:

``` text
BEGIN source transaction
UPDATE source
COMMIT source transaction
INVALIDATE cache
```

Only invalidate after the authoritative commit succeeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 5 --- Invalidation Failure

## 12. Failure Window

Timeline:

``` text
T1 source update commits V2
T2 Redis invalidation fails
```

State:

``` text
source = V2
cache  = V1
```

The TTL becomes the fallback repair mechanism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 13. Operational Requirements

Measure:

``` text
cache_invalidation_total
cache_invalidation_error_total
```

Alert based on:

``` text
freshness criticality
failure rate
duration
affected namespace
```

Do not silently ignore invalidation failures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 6 --- Concurrent Read/Write Race

## 14. Stale Repopulation

One of the most important cache-aside races:

``` text
T1 Reader A: Redis miss
T2 Reader A: starts source read -> V1
T3 Writer B: source update -> V2
T4 Writer B: invalidates Redis
T5 Reader A: finishes old source read V1
T6 Reader A: writes V1 into Redis
```

Final state:

``` text
source = V2
cache  = V1
```

The invalidation happened correctly, but stale data returned afterward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 7 --- Why TTL Still Matters

## 15. Safety Bound

If stale V1 is accidentally repopulated:

``` text
TTL = 5 minutes
```

then the stale entry eventually disappears.

Without TTL:

``` text
stale value may persist indefinitely
```

TTL is not a complete consistency mechanism, but it limits damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 8 --- Delayed Second Invalidation

## 16. Concept

A mitigation sometimes used for read/write races:

``` text
1. Update source.
2. Invalidate cache.
3. Wait longer than expected in-flight stale read.
4. Invalidate same cache key again.
```

Conceptually:

``` text
source update
    |
invalidate
    |
short controlled delay
    |
invalidate again
```

This is often called delayed double deletion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 17. What It Tries to Solve

If an old in-flight reader repopulates stale data after the first
invalidation:

``` text
second invalidation removes it
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 18. Limitations

It is not a mathematical consistency guarantee.

Problems:

``` text
how long should delay be?
source read latency varies
network pauses vary
worker scheduling varies
second delete can fail
more Redis traffic
more application complexity
```

Use only after analyzing the actual race and correctness requirement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 9 --- Version-Based Protection

## 19. Version the Source Record

Example authoritative records:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "status": "active",
  "version": 41
}
```

After update:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "status": "inactive",
  "version": 42
}
```

Now cache freshness can be reasoned about using:

``` text
version
```

rather than only timing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 20. Cache Version

Cached object:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "status": "inactive",
  "version": 42
}
```

A stale reader holding:

``` text
version 41
```

should not overwrite cached:

``` text
version 42
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 10 --- Atomic Version Check

## 21. Need for Atomicity

This is unsafe:

``` text
GET current cache
compare version in application
SET older/newer value
```

because another writer can change Redis between GET and SET.

Use an atomic mechanism such as:

``` text
Lua script
transaction pattern where appropriate
supported server-side conditional mechanism
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 22. Conceptual Lua

For a simplified numeric-version side key:

``` lua
local current = redis.call("GET", KEYS[1])

if current and tonumber(current) >= tonumber(ARGV[1]) then
    return 0
end

redis.call("SET", KEYS[1], ARGV[1], "EX", ARGV[3])
redis.call("SET", KEYS[2], ARGV[2], "EX", ARGV[3])

return 1
```

A production implementation must ensure the version and value update
form a correct atomic model and that multi-key placement is compatible
with the deployment architecture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 11 --- Version in the Cache Key

## 23. Alternative Design

Instead of:

``` text
cache:profile:1001
```

use:

``` text
cache:profile:1001:v42
```

Then newer versions do not overwrite older keys.

But the application must know which version is current.

This can require:

``` text
metadata key
source version lookup
event-driven version pointer
```

It trades overwrite races for key lifecycle complexity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 12 --- Timestamp-Based Protection

## 24. Timestamp

A source may expose:

``` text
updated_at
```

Example:

``` text
2026-10-07T12:30:45Z
```

The cache can store it and reject older updates.

But timestamps require care:

``` text
clock consistency
timestamp precision
multiple writes at same timestamp
source semantics
```

A monotonic source version is often easier to reason about when
available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 13 --- Event-Driven Invalidation

## 25. Architecture

Instead of the request path directly deleting Redis:

``` text
Source update
     |
     v
Event
     |
     v
Message Broker
     |
     v
Cache Invalidation Consumer
     |
     v
Redis
```

Possible event infrastructure:

``` text
Kafka
Amazon MSK
event bus
queue
CDC platform
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 26. Benefits

``` text
decouples writer from cache
supports multiple cache consumers
centralizes invalidation logic
provides replay possibilities
can scale independently
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 27. Risks

``` text
event delay
duplicate events
out-of-order events
consumer outage
poison events
broker outage
schema changes
replay behavior
```

Event-driven invalidation introduces distributed-system complexity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 14 --- Event Payload

## 28. Example

``` json
{
  "event_type": "profile.updated",
  "profile_id": "1001",
  "version": 42,
  "occurred_at": "2026-10-07T12:30:45Z"
}
```

The invalidation consumer can derive:

``` text
cache:profile:1001:v1
```

and invalidate it.

Avoid putting unnecessary sensitive data into invalidation events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 15 --- Idempotent Invalidation

## 29. Duplicate Events

Suppose the same event arrives twice.

Consumer performs:

``` redis
UNLINK cache:profile:1001:v1
```

twice.

The second delete simply finds the key absent.

This makes deletion naturally convenient for idempotent event
processing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 16 --- Out-of-Order Events

## 30. Example

Events arrive:

``` text
version 42
then
version 41
```

If both only delete:

``` text
deleting an already absent key is generally harmless
```

If events rewrite cache contents:

``` text
version 41 could overwrite version 42
```

This is another reason invalidation is often simpler than event-driven
cache updating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 17 --- CDC-Driven Invalidation

## 31. Change Data Capture

CDC observes authoritative data changes and emits change records.

Conceptually:

``` text
Database
   |
   v
CDC
   |
   v
Kafka / Event Stream
   |
   v
Invalidation Consumer
   |
   v
Redis
```

This can remove cache invalidation logic from individual writers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 32. CDC Benefits

``` text
captures changes from multiple writers
centralized cache consistency
audit/replay capability
less application coupling
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 33. CDC Risks

``` text
CDC lag
connector outage
consumer lag
schema changes
duplicate events
replay storms
incorrect key mapping
```

Monitor end-to-end invalidation lag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 18 --- Invalidation Lag

## 34. Definition

Conceptually:

``` text
invalidation lag =
cache invalidation time - source commit time
```

If business tolerance is:

``` text
30 seconds
```

and CDC lag becomes:

``` text
10 minutes
```

the cache consistency SLO is violated even if Redis is healthy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 19 --- Multi-Instance Applications

## 35. Local Memory + Redis

Some applications have:

``` text
L1 local process cache
L2 Redis
L3 source database
```

Now invalidation must consider:

``` text
all application instances
+
Redis
```

Deleting only Redis does not invalidate stale values already stored in
process memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 36. Multi-Level Invalidation

Conceptually:

``` text
Source change
    |
    v
Invalidation event
    |
    +----> Redis invalidation
    |
    +----> App instance A local cache
    |
    +----> App instance B local cache
    |
    +----> App instance C local cache
```

This requires coordinated invalidation or deliberately short local TTLs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 20 --- Partial Updates

## 37. Cached Aggregate

Suppose cache contains:

``` json
{
  "id": "1001",
  "name": "Alice",
  "address": "A",
  "status": "active"
}
```

Source update changes only:

``` text
address
```

Should Redis patch only the address?

Possible, but now cache logic must reproduce source update semantics
correctly.

Simpler:

``` text
invalidate whole cached aggregate
```

when the next read can cheaply reconstruct it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 21 --- Derived Cache Entries

## 38. One Source Change, Many Keys

A source update may affect:

``` text
cache:profile:1001
cache:profile-summary:1001
cache:search-result:region:north
cache:dashboard:customer:500
```

Invalidation becomes dependency management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 39. Dependency Registry

For complex caching, document:

``` text
source entity
affected cache namespaces
invalidation trigger
owner
TTL fallback
```

Example:

  Source Entity   Cache Namespace     Trigger           TTL
  --------------- ------------------- ----------------- -------
  Profile         `cache:profile:*`   profile.updated   5 min
  Profile         `cache:summary:*`   profile.updated   2 min

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 22 --- Broad Invalidation

## 40. Avoid Wildcard Deletes

Do not solve dependency complexity with:

``` text
find every matching production key and delete everything
```

Broad scans/deletes can create:

``` text
Redis load
mass cache misses
source overload
```

Prefer precise key derivation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 23 --- Generational / Namespace Versioning

## 41. Generation Pattern

Instead of deleting millions of keys, applications can sometimes use a
generation:

``` text
cache:catalog:g17:item:1001
```

A new generation:

``` text
g18
```

causes applications to stop reading old-generation keys.

Old keys expire naturally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42. Tradeoff

Benefits:

``` text
fast logical invalidation
avoids mass delete
```

Costs:

``` text
temporary duplicate memory
generation coordination
old-key cleanup via TTL
```

Useful for large cache sets when designed carefully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 24 --- Consistency Models

## 43. Strong Consistency

Every read sees the latest committed write.

Classic cache-aside generally does not provide this automatically across
independent source and cache systems.

If strict strong consistency is mandatory, caching strategy must be
designed accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44. Eventual Consistency

Cache may temporarily differ from source but converges through:

``` text
invalidation
TTL
refresh
event processing
```

Many cache-aside systems operate here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 45. Bounded Staleness

A useful cache requirement:

``` text
cached data may be at most N minutes stale
```

TTL plus invalidation monitoring can support this model.

Example:

``` text
maximum tolerated stale window = 5 minutes
```

Now TTL and invalidation SLOs have a business basis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 25 --- Read-Your-Writes

## 46. Requirement

A user updates a record and immediately reads it.

They expect:

``` text
new value
```

But if cache invalidation is delayed:

``` text
old value may be returned
```

Possible solutions depend on architecture:

``` text
invalidate synchronously after commit
bypass cache for immediate follow-up read
session-local version knowledge
version-aware cache
```

Define whether read-your-writes is required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 26 --- Failure Windows

## 47. Source Commit + Invalidation

Window:

``` text
source commit succeeds
invalidation not yet completed
```

Potential stale read.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 48. Event-Based Invalidation

Window:

``` text
source commit
event publish
broker
consumer
Redis delete
```

Each stage adds potential delay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 49. TTL-Only

Window:

``` text
up to remaining TTL
```

Simple but often much larger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 27 --- Observability

## 50. Required Metrics

Capture:

``` text
cache_invalidation_total
cache_invalidation_success_total
cache_invalidation_error_total
cache_invalidation_latency
cache_stale_detected_total
cache_version_reject_total
invalidation_event_total
invalidation_event_error_total
invalidation_consumer_lag
invalidation_age
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 51. Correlate With

``` text
source update rate
cache hit rate
Redis errors
application latency
source latency
event-broker lag
consumer restarts
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 28 --- Logging

## 52. Useful Structured Fields

Example:

``` json
{
  "event": "cache_invalidation",
  "namespace": "profile",
  "entity_id": "1001",
  "source_version": 42,
  "result": "success"
}
```

Do not log sensitive payloads unnecessarily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hands-On Lab

## 53. Lab Namespace

Use:

``` text
tutorial:chapter13:
```

Use a simulated authoritative store.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 54. Source Store

``` python
SOURCE = {
    "1001": {
        "id": "1001",
        "status": "active",
        "version": 1,
    }
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 55. Cache Key

``` python
def cache_key(profile_id):
    return f"tutorial:chapter13:profile:{profile_id}"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 56. Read Function

``` python
import json

def get_profile(r, profile_id):
    key = cache_key(profile_id)

    cached = r.get(key)

    if cached is not None:
        return json.loads(cached)

    value = SOURCE.get(profile_id)

    if value is None:
        return None

    r.set(
        key,
        json.dumps(value),
        ex=120,
    )

    return value
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 29 --- Basic Invalidation Lab

## 57. Populate

``` python
print(get_profile(r, "1001"))
```

Verify:

``` redis
GET tutorial:chapter13:profile:1001
TTL tutorial:chapter13:profile:1001
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 58. Update Source

``` python
SOURCE["1001"] = {
    "id": "1001",
    "status": "inactive",
    "version": 2,
}
```

Redis still contains old data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 59. Invalidate

``` redis
UNLINK tutorial:chapter13:profile:1001
```

Read again:

``` python
print(get_profile(r, "1001"))
```

Expected:

``` text
version 2
status inactive
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 30 --- Invalidation Failure Lab

## 60. Simulate Failure

Conceptually:

``` text
source update succeeds
Redis temporarily unavailable
invalidation fails
```

Record:

``` text
source version
cached version
TTL remaining
```

Observe the stale-data window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 31 --- Stale Repopulation Race Lab

## 61. Simulated Slow Read

``` python
import copy
import time

def slow_source_read(profile_id):
    value = copy.deepcopy(SOURCE[profile_id])
    time.sleep(2)
    return value
```

Sequence:

``` text
1. Remove cache.
2. Start slow read that captures version 1.
3. Update source to version 2.
4. Invalidate cache.
5. Allow slow reader to cache version 1.
```

Expected:

``` text
cache can become stale after invalidation
```

This is the critical race to understand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 32 --- Version Comparison Lab

## 62. Read Cached Version

Cached JSON includes:

``` json
{
  "version": 2
}
```

Before replacing it with source data, compare versions.

Conceptually:

``` python
if incoming_version < cached_version:
    reject_cache_write()
```

But production comparison-and-write must be atomic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 33 --- Event Invalidation Lab

## 63. Simulated Event

``` python
event = {
    "event_type": "profile.updated",
    "profile_id": "1001",
    "version": 3,
}
```

Consumer:

``` python
def handle_event(r, event):
    if event["event_type"] == "profile.updated":
        r.unlink(cache_key(event["profile_id"]))
```

Run twice.

Expected:

``` text
duplicate processing is harmless
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 34 --- Out-of-Order Event Lab

## 64. Events

``` python
events = [
    {"profile_id": "1001", "version": 4},
    {"profile_id": "1001", "version": 3},
]
```

If handler only invalidates:

``` text
both are safe to process repeatedly
```

If handler writes cached data:

``` text
version ordering must be enforced
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Failure Injection

## 65. Failure 1 --- Source Succeeds, Invalidation Fails

State:

``` text
source new
cache old
```

Mitigation:

``` text
TTL
retry if safe
alert
repair exact key
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 66. Failure 2 --- Cache Updated Before Source, Source Fails

State:

``` text
cache contains uncommitted/non-authoritative value
```

Lesson:

``` text
do not treat cache as commit authority
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 67. Failure 3 --- Stale Repopulation

State:

``` text
source V2
cache V1
```

after apparently successful invalidation.

Investigate concurrent source reads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 68. Failure 4 --- Duplicate Event

Same invalidation event processed twice.

Expected with delete-based invalidation:

``` text
idempotent behavior
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 69. Failure 5 --- Out-of-Order Cache Update Events

Events:

``` text
V42
V41
```

If consumer writes values blindly:

``` text
V41 may overwrite V42
```

Use version fencing or invalidate instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 70. Failure 6 --- Consumer Lag

Source:

``` text
V50
```

Redis:

``` text
V45
```

Invalidation consumer:

``` text
10 minutes behind
```

Redis may be perfectly healthy.

The consistency system is not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 71. Failure 7 --- Local L1 Cache Not Invalidated

Redis is fresh.

Application instance still serves stale in-process value.

Troubleshoot every cache layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 72. Failure 8 --- Broad Invalidation Storm

Deployment invalidates:

``` text
millions of keys
```

simultaneously.

Potential result:

``` text
mass cache misses
source overload
Redis delete load
```

Use staged/generational strategies where appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 73. Failure 9 --- TTL Too Long for Failure Window

Invalidation fails.

TTL:

``` text
24 hours
```

Freshness requirement:

``` text
5 minutes
```

TTL safety net does not satisfy the business requirement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 74. Failure 10 --- Derived Cache Missed

Source entity changes.

Primary cache invalidated:

``` text
cache:profile:1001
```

but derived cache remains:

``` text
cache:profile-summary:1001
```

Result:

``` text
partial consistency
```

Maintain dependency mapping.

# Troubleshooting

## 75. User Reports Old Data

Start:

``` text
exact entity
source current value
cache current value
source version
cache version
TTL
```

Then build the timeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 76. Source New, Redis Old

Check:

``` text
invalidation called?
invalidation succeeded?
correct key?
correct namespace?
Redis connectivity?
consumer lag?
TTL?
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 77. Redis Became Old After Successful Invalidation

Suspect:

``` text
stale repopulation race
out-of-order event
old writer
local cache layer
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 78. Only Some App Instances Serve Old Data

Check:

``` text
L1/local cache
instance-specific configuration
event subscription
deployment version
```

Redis may not be the stale layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 79. Staleness Appears During High Load

Check:

``` text
consumer lag
source latency
in-flight reads
retry queues
broker lag
cache population races
```

High latency increases race windows.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Requirement                         Possible Design Direction
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Minutes of staleness acceptable     Cache-aside + TTL

  Fast freshness after writes         Source-first + invalidation

  Multiple writers                    CDC/event-driven invalidation

  Duplicate events expected           Idempotent delete

  Out-of-order value updates          Version fencing

  Millions of related keys            Generational invalidation

  L1 + Redis caches                   Multi-layer invalidation

  Read-your-writes required           Synchronous
                                      invalidation/bypass/version-aware

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 90. Lab Cleanup

Find chapter keys:

``` redis
SCAN 0 MATCH 'tutorial:chapter13:*' COUNT 100
```

Delete only exact lab keys:

``` redis
UNLINK <exact-key>
```

Do not use:

``` redis
FLUSHDB
FLUSHALL
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 91. Key Takeaways

1.  Cache invalidation is a distributed consistency problem, not merely
    a Redis command.
2.  Source-first ordering prevents Redis from becoming the authority for
    an uncommitted write.
3.  Deleting cache entries is often easier to reason about than
    dual-writing values.
4.  Every source/cache ordering has a failure window.
5.  TTL is the fallback stale-data bound when invalidation fails.
6.  Concurrent readers can repopulate stale data after a correct
    invalidation.
7.  Delayed second invalidation can reduce a specific race but does not
    guarantee strong consistency.
8.  Monotonic source versions can prevent older data from replacing
    newer cache state.
9.  Event-driven invalidation must handle duplicates, ordering, lag, and
    replay.
10. Delete-based invalidation is naturally easier to make idempotent.
11. CDC can centralize invalidation across multiple source writers.
12. Consumer/CDC lag is a cache-freshness metric.
13. Local L1 caches and derived caches must be included in the
    consistency model.
14. Broad invalidation can create a source-system incident.
15. Production cache consistency must be defined using explicit
    freshness requirements and observable failure bounds.

# 92. References

Validate all Redis command behavior, scripting behavior,
cluster/multi-key restrictions, client semantics, and Redis Enterprise
compatibility against the exact versions deployed.

Recommended official documentation areas:

-   Redis caching patterns
-   cache-aside
-   `SET`
-   `GET`
-   `DEL`
-   `UNLINK`
-   `EXPIRE`
-   `TTL`
-   Lua scripting
-   transactions
-   Redis keyspace notifications where relevant
-   Redis Streams where used for event processing
-   Redis Enterprise client and database behavior

Event-driven and CDC invalidation are architectural patterns whose exact
implementation depends on the source database, broker, CDC platform,
client framework, and consistency requirements.
