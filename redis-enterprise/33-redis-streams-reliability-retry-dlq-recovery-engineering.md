------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Objective

Chapter 32 introduced Redis Streams and consumer groups.

This chapter focuses on what happens when production processing fails.

A normal path is:

``` text
XADD
  |
  v
Stream
  |
  v
Consumer Group
  |
  v
Consumer
  |
  +--> success --> XACK
  |
  +--> failure --> retry / pending / recovery / DLQ
```

The difficult part is not receiving an event.

The difficult part is safely handling:

``` text
consumer crashes
timeouts
partial business commits
retries
duplicate delivery
poison messages
long outages
large backlogs
recovery storms
DLQ replay
```

By the end, you should be able to:

-   Explain the Pending Entries List lifecycle.
-   Detect abandoned work.
-   Size reclaim thresholds safely.
-   Distinguish retryable and non-retryable failures.
-   Prevent tight retry loops.
-   Design delayed retries.
-   Build bounded retry policies.
-   Isolate poison events.
-   Design a DLQ.
-   Replay DLQ events safely.
-   Design idempotent processing.
-   Define deduplication windows.
-   Recover after consumer fleet outages.
-   Model backlog catch-up time.
-   Define lag SLOs.
-   Protect downstream systems during recovery.
-   Build reliability dashboards.
-   Inject realistic failures.
-   Execute production runbooks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Core Production Principle

Redis Streams can preserve events and track pending delivery, but
application reliability is not automatic.

A production consumer must explicitly define:

``` text
when work is complete
when to ACK
what can retry
how long to retry
who recovers abandoned work
how duplicates are handled
where poison events go
how backlog is recovered
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 1 --- Processing State Machine

## 3. Event Lifecycle

A useful model is:

``` text
NEW
 |
 v
DELIVERED
 |
 v
PENDING
 | \
 |  \ failure
 |   v
 | RETRY
 |   |
 |   +--> success --> ACKED
 |   |
 |   +--> exhausted --> DLQ
 |
 +--> success --> ACKED
```

This state machine should be documented for each consumer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2 --- Pending Entries List

## 4. PEL Purpose

For consumer groups, delivered but unacknowledged messages are tracked
as pending.

The PEL helps answer:

``` text
Which events are unfinished?
Which consumer owns them?
How long have they been idle?
How many times were they delivered?
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 3 --- `XPENDING`

## 5. Summary

``` redis
XPENDING tutorial:chapter33:orders order-workers
```

Use detailed forms supported by your Redis version to inspect specific
pending entries and consumers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 4 --- Healthy Pending Work

## 6. Pending Does Not Always Mean Broken

A message may be pending because:

``` text
consumer is actively processing it
downstream operation is slow but healthy
batch is still in progress
```

Do not reclaim simply because pending count is nonzero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 5 --- Abandoned Work

## 7. Definition

An event is likely abandoned when:

``` text
owning consumer is gone
and
idle duration exceeds normal processing behavior
```

Both conditions matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 6 --- Reclaim Threshold

## 8. Measure First

Suppose normal processing is:

``` text
P50 = 200 ms
P95 = 2 s
P99 = 8 s
max expected = 20 s
```

A reclaim threshold of:

``` text
3 s
```

is unsafe.

A threshold such as:

``` text
60 s
```

may be more appropriate, depending on workload and failure objectives.

Do not copy this value blindly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 7 --- Reclaim Risk

## 9. Concurrent Duplicate Processing

If Consumer A is still processing and Consumer B reclaims the same
event:

``` text
A -> business operation
B -> same business operation
```

Both may execute concurrently.

Idempotency must protect the business effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 8 --- `XCLAIM`

## 10. Explicit Claim

Conceptually:

``` redis
XCLAIM stream group recovery-worker <min-idle-ms> <stream-id>
```

Use when the recovery process has identified specific abandoned entries.

Validate exact syntax for the deployed Redis version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 9 --- `XAUTOCLAIM`

## 11. Scanning Recovery

Where supported:

``` redis
XAUTOCLAIM stream group recovery-worker 60000 0-0 COUNT 100
```

This can scan for sufficiently idle pending entries and claim them.

Use bounded `COUNT`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 10 --- Recovery Loop

## 12. Pattern

``` text
claim bounded batch
        |
        v
validate event
        |
        v
check idempotency
        |
        v
process
        |
   +----+----+
   |         |
 success   failure
   |         |
 XACK     retry/DLQ
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 11 --- Failure Classification

## 13. Retryable

Examples may include:

``` text
temporary timeout
HTTP 503
temporary connection failure
short dependency outage
rate-limit response
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 12 --- Non-Retryable

## 14. Examples

Potentially:

``` text
invalid schema
unsupported event version
missing mandatory field
permanent business validation failure
invalid identifier
```

Application semantics decide classification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 13 --- Unknown Failure

## 15. Safe Policy

Do not automatically classify every unknown exception as infinitely
retryable.

Unknown failures should have:

``` text
bounded retries
telemetry
operator visibility
eventual quarantine
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 14 --- Retry Budget

## 16. Define

Example:

``` text
attempt 1: immediate processing
attempt 2: after short delay
attempt 3: after longer delay
attempt 4: after longer delay
then DLQ/quarantine
```

The exact budget depends on dependency behavior and business
requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 15 --- Retry Amplification

## 17. Equation

If:

``` text
original events = 10,000/sec
each failure retries 5 times
```

the system may create:

``` text
up to 50,000 additional attempts/sec
```

depending on implementation.

Retries consume real capacity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 16 --- Tight Retry Loop

## 18. Anti-Pattern

``` text
fail
retry immediately
fail
retry immediately
...
```

This can overload:

``` text
Redis
consumer CPU
downstream database
HTTP service
logs
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 17 --- Backoff

## 19. Pattern

Use increasing delays:

``` text
1 s
5 s
30 s
2 min
```

according to the failure class.

Add jitter when many consumers may retry together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 18 --- Retry Scheduling

## 20. Streams Do Not Automatically Schedule Future Retries

A pending entry does not itself become a delayed scheduler.

Applications need an explicit retry design.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 19 --- Retry Design A: Leave Pending

## 21. Concept

Keep failed work pending and let a recovery process revisit it later.

Benefits:

``` text
simple
original stream ID retained
```

Risks:

``` text
PEL can grow
retry timing is application-managed
poison messages remain pending
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 20 --- Retry Design B: Retry Stream

## 22. Concept

Move/copy retry metadata to a dedicated retry stream.

Example:

``` text
orders.events.retry
```

Fields:

``` text
original_event_id
original_stream_id
attempt
retry_after
failure_class
```

A retry scheduler/worker reintroduces eligible work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 21 --- Retry Design C: Sorted-Set Scheduler

## 23. Concept

Use a sorted set:

``` text
score = retry timestamp
member = retry reference
```

Workers query due items.

This adds application complexity and atomicity requirements.

Use only when justified.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 22 --- Retry Metadata

## 24. Recommended

Track:

``` text
event ID
original stream ID
attempt
first failure time
last failure time
failure class
next retry time
```

Do not store sensitive exception payloads unnecessarily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 23 --- Poison Event

## 25. Definition

A poison event fails consistently regardless of retry timing.

Example:

``` json
{
  "event_version": 999,
  "required_field": null
}
```

Repeated retries waste capacity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 24 --- Poison Isolation

## 26. Policy

After bounded attempts:

``` text
capture diagnostic metadata
write to DLQ/quarantine
ACK original according to design
alert/measure
continue processing healthy events
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 25 --- Dead-Letter Queue

## 27. Redis Stream DLQ

Example:

``` text
tutorial:chapter33:orders:dlq
```

DLQ entry:

``` text
event_id
original_stream
original_stream_id
event_type
attempt
failure_class
failure_reason_code
failed_at
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 26 --- Payload Policy

## 28. Avoid Blind Copies

Copying the entire original payload into the DLQ may:

``` text
duplicate memory
duplicate sensitive data
increase persistence
increase retention cost
```

Decide whether to store:

``` text
full payload
sanitized payload
reference only
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 27 --- DLQ Monitoring

## 29. Required Metrics

Track:

``` text
DLQ additions/sec
DLQ total length
oldest unresolved DLQ age
failure class
event type
producer version
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 28 --- DLQ Ownership

## 30. Operational Requirement

Every DLQ needs:

``` text
owner
alert threshold
triage procedure
fix workflow
replay procedure
retention
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 29 --- Replay Safety

## 31. Never Blindly Replay Everything

Before replay:

``` text
fix root cause
validate one event
confirm idempotency
confirm downstream capacity
rate-limit replay
monitor errors
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 30 --- Replay Batch

## 32. Bounded

Example operational sequence:

``` text
replay 10
validate
replay 100
validate
increase gradually
```

Avoid sending a large DLQ directly into a recovering downstream system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 31 --- Replay Identity

## 33. Preserve Event ID

A replayed event should preserve the business identity needed for
idempotency.

It may receive a new stream ID while retaining:

``` text
original event_id
original stream_id
replay_id
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 32 --- Idempotency

## 34. Core Requirement

Consumers must assume that an event can be delivered more than once.

Design:

``` text
same event
+
multiple processing attempts
=
one intended business effect
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 33 --- Database Constraint

## 35. Strong Pattern

For business records, an authoritative database uniqueness/version
constraint may provide stronger correctness than an expiring Redis
marker.

Example concept:

``` text
UNIQUE(event_id)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 34 --- State Version

## 36. Alternative

If events describe entity versions:

``` text
customer 1001 version 7
```

consumer can reject an already-applied or older version according to
domain semantics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 35 --- Redis Deduplication Window

## 37. Bounded Suppression

For non-permanent deduplication:

``` redis
SET dedupe:event:abc123 1 NX EX 86400
```

This suppresses duplicates only while the marker exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 36 --- Deduplication Window

## 38. Sizing

The window should exceed the plausible duplicate/replay interval if
Redis markers are used.

Consider:

``` text
consumer outage
retry horizon
DLQ replay delay
deployment delay
retention
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 37 --- Idempotency Race

## 39. Check-Then-Act Risk

Unsafe:

``` text
check marker
perform business action
write marker
```

Two consumers can race.

Use an atomic/authoritative design appropriate to the business effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 38 --- ACK Boundary

## 40. Failure Window

``` text
business commit succeeds
        |
        X crash
        |
        no ACK
```

The message will be eligible for recovery.

This is why ACK cannot replace idempotency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 39 --- Consumer Fleet Outage

## 41. Scenario

Producer continues:

``` text
5,000 events/sec
```

Consumers are offline:

``` text
30 minutes
```

Backlog:

``` text
5,000 × 1,800
=
9,000,000 events
```

before considering retention and entry-size overhead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 40 --- Catch-Up Capacity

## 42. Formula

If:

``` text
producer rate = P
consumer total rate = C
```

net catch-up rate:

``` text
C - P
```

only when:

``` text
C > P
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 41 --- Catch-Up Time

## 43. Formula

``` text
catch-up time
=
backlog
/
(consumer capacity - producer rate)
```

Example:

``` text
backlog = 9,000,000
P = 5,000/sec
C = 8,000/sec
net = 3,000/sec

catch-up = 3,000 sec
≈ 50 minutes
```

assuming dependencies sustain the rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 42 --- Recovery Storm

## 44. Risk

Starting all consumers at maximum speed can overload:

``` text
database
HTTP dependencies
Redis
network
CPU
```

A backlog is not permission to ignore downstream capacity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 43 --- Recovery Pacing

## 45. Controls

Use:

``` text
consumer concurrency
batch size
rate limit
dependency concurrency
retry budget
gradual replica scaling
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 44 --- Lag SLO

## 46. Define Time, Not Only Count

Example:

``` text
99% of events processed within 60 seconds
```

This is often more meaningful than:

``` text
backlog < 10,000
```

because event rates change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 45 --- Oldest Pending Age

## 47. Critical Signal

Track:

``` text
oldest pending age
```

A small pending count containing one 6-hour-old event may be more
concerning than 1,000 entries pending for 200 ms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 46 --- Consumer Health

## 48. Useful Signals

``` text
consumer heartbeat
last successful event time
processing rate
error rate
pending count
oldest pending
reclaim count
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 47 --- Zombie Consumer

## 49. Definition

A consumer may still exist in group metadata even though its process is
gone.

Operational cleanup must distinguish:

``` text
inactive metadata
from
pending work still assigned to it
```

Do not remove consumer metadata without understanding pending ownership.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 48 --- Consumer Deletion

## 50. Caution

Redis supports consumer-group administration commands that can remove
consumers.

Validate exact behavior regarding pending entries for the deployed Redis
version before using them operationally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 49 --- Retention vs. Recovery

## 51. Recovery Window

Retention should cover at least the intended:

``` text
maximum outage
+
catch-up time
+
operational safety margin
```

subject to memory/capacity constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 50 --- Retention Example

## 52. Scenario

If the system must tolerate:

``` text
2-hour consumer outage
+
1-hour catch-up
```

then a 30-minute retention policy is incompatible with that recovery
requirement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 51 --- DLQ Retention

## 53. Separate Policy

DLQ events may need different retention from the primary stream.

Define:

``` text
maximum triage delay
audit requirement
replay requirement
sensitive-data policy
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 52 --- Backpressure

## 54. Consumer Side

Bound:

``` text
batch size
workers
in-flight operations
downstream connections
```

Do not load huge batches into application memory merely because a
backlog exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 53 --- Producer Backpressure

## 55. When Possible

If lag becomes unsafe, systems may need to:

``` text
slow producers
reject low-priority work
shed optional events
switch to degraded mode
```

only where business semantics allow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 54 --- Priority

## 56. Separate Workloads

If critical and bulk events share one stream/group, bulk backlog may
affect critical work.

Possible design:

``` text
critical stream
standard stream
bulk stream
```

But more streams increase operational complexity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 55 --- Ordering vs. Parallelism

## 57. Tradeoff

More consumers improve parallelism but may complicate business ordering.

If events for the same entity must be processed in order, design
partitioning/version checks accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 56 --- Observability Dashboard

import redis

r = redis.Redis(
    host=os.getenv(
        "REDIS_HOST",
        "localhost",
    ),
    port=int(
        os.getenv(
            "REDIS_PORT",
            "6379",
        )
    ),
    password=(
        os.getenv("REDIS_PASSWORD")
        or None
    ),
    decode_responses=True,
)

STREAM = "tutorial:chapter33:orders"

for i in range(100):
    r.xadd(
        STREAM,
        {
            "event_id":
                str(uuid.uuid4()),
            "event_version": "1",
            "event_type":
                "order.created",
            "order_id":
                str(1000 + i),
            "occurred_at":
                str(time.time()),
        },
    )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 62 --- Create Group

## 68. Command

``` redis
XGROUP CREATE tutorial:chapter33:orders order-workers 0 MKSTREAM
```

Handle `BUSYGROUP` safely in reusable startup code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 63 --- Create Pending Work

## 69. Read Without ACK

``` redis
XREADGROUP GROUP order-workers worker-1 COUNT 5 STREAMS tutorial:chapter33:orders >
```

Do not ACK these entries yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 64 --- Inspect PEL

## 70. Command

``` redis
XPENDING tutorial:chapter33:orders order-workers
```

Record:

``` text
pending count
consumer
idle behavior
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 65 --- Crash Simulation

## 71. Procedure

Treat `worker-1` as crashed.

Wait longer than the lab reclaim threshold.

Use a recovery consumer to claim the entries.

Do not use a short production threshold merely to make the lab faster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 66 --- Auto-Claim

## 72. Example

Where supported:

``` redis
XAUTOCLAIM tutorial:chapter33:orders order-workers recovery-worker 10000 0-0 COUNT 5
```

The 10-second value is for an isolated learning lab only.

Production values must be based on measured processing duration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 67 --- Retry Metadata

## 73. Retry Stream Example

``` python
def schedule_retry(
    r,
    fields,
    stream_id,
    attempt,
    reason,
):
    retry_stream = (
        "tutorial:chapter33:"
        "orders:retry"
    )

    retry_after = (
        time.time()
        + min(
            60,
            2 ** attempt,
        )
    )

    r.xadd(
        retry_stream,
        {
            "event_id":
                fields["event_id"],
            "original_stream_id":
                stream_id,
            "attempt":
                str(attempt),
            "retry_after":
                str(retry_after),
            "failure_class":
                reason,
        },
    )
```

This demonstrates metadata design; a complete retry scheduler still
needs to enforce `retry_after`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 68 --- Poison Event

## 74. Publish

``` redis
XADD tutorial:chapter33:orders * event_id poison-1 event_version 999 event_type order.created order_id 9999
```

Classify unsupported version as non-retryable according to lab policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 69 --- DLQ Function

## 75. Example

``` python
def send_to_dlq(
    r,
    stream_id,
    fields,
    attempt,
    reason,
):
    r.xadd(
        "tutorial:chapter33:"
        "orders:dlq",
        {
            "event_id":
                fields.get(
                    "event_id",
                    "",
                ),
            "original_stream_id":
                stream_id,
            "event_type":
                fields.get(
                    "event_type",
                    "",
                ),
            "attempt":
                str(attempt),
            "failure_class":
                reason,
            "failed_at":
                str(time.time()),
        },
    )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    )

    return bool(
        r.set(
            key,
            "1",
            nx=True,
            ex=3600,
        )
    )
```

Run the same event twice.

The second call should be detected as a duplicate within the one-hour
lab window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 71 --- Idempotency Limitation

## 77. Important

The lab marker is not a universal exactly-once solution.

Problems include:

``` text
marker expiry
business-write race
Redis outage
marker loss
cross-system atomicity
```

Use an authoritative transactional/idempotent design for critical
business effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 72 --- DLQ Replay Lab

## 78. Procedure

1.  Fix the simulated consumer bug.
2.  Read one DLQ entry.
3.  Preserve `event_id`.
4.  Republish one corrected/replay event.
5.  Verify idempotency.
6.  Confirm success.
7.  ACK/delete/mark DLQ entry according to design.
8.  Increase replay batch gradually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 73 --- Outage Backlog Lab

## 79. Procedure

1.  Stop consumers.
2.  Produce events for a fixed period.
3.  Record producer rate.
4.  Measure backlog.
5.  Restart one consumer.
6.  Measure processing rate.
7.  Add consumers gradually.
8.  calculate net catch-up.
9.  compare predicted vs. observed recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 74 --- Catch-Up Calculator

## 80. Python

``` python
backlog = 900000
producer_rate = 500
consumer_rate = 800

net = (
    consumer_rate
    - producer_rate
)

if net <= 0:
    print(
        "Cannot catch up"
    )
else:
    seconds = backlog / net

    print(
        "catch-up seconds:",
        round(seconds, 1),
    )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 75 --- Recovery Pacing Lab

## 81. Compare

Run catch-up with:

``` text
1 consumer
2 consumers
4 consumers
```

Measure:

``` text
Redis CPU
dependency latency
dependency errors
processing rate
lag reduction
```

Stop scaling when another dependency becomes the bottleneck.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 76 --- Failure Injection

## 82. Failure 1 --- Consumer Crash

Crash after receiving but before ACK.

Verify PEL recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 83. Failure 2 --- Crash After Business Commit

Simulate business success then crash before ACK.

Reclaim and verify idempotency prevents duplicate effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 84. Failure 3 --- Reclaim Too Early

Set an artificially low lab reclaim threshold.

Run a slow healthy consumer.

Observe duplicate concurrent processing risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 85. Failure 4 --- Infinite Retry

Retry a deterministic poison event without cap.

Observe amplification.

Then apply bounded attempts and DLQ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 86. Failure 5 --- Retry Storm

Make a downstream dependency fail for all consumers.

Retry aggressively.

Observe increased request volume.

Add backoff/jitter and concurrency limits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 87. Failure 6 --- DLQ Replay Storm

Replay many DLQ events simultaneously.

Observe downstream pressure.

Repeat with bounded replay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 88. Failure 7 --- Deduplication Window Too Short

Use a very short marker TTL.

Wait for expiry.

Replay the same event.

Observe that duplicate suppression no longer exists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 89. Failure 8 --- Fleet Outage

Stop all consumers while producer continues.

Measure backlog and recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 90. Failure 9 --- Insufficient Catch-Up Capacity

Configure consumer throughput equal to or below producer throughput.

Observe that backlog never converges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 91. Failure 10 --- Retention Shorter Than Recovery Objective

In a disposable lab, configure retention incompatible with the planned
outage window.

Demonstrate why retention and recovery objectives must be designed
together.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 77 --- Troubleshooting

## 92. Pending Count Increasing

Check:

``` text
consumer processing time
consumer errors
ACK failures
dependency latency
consumer crashes
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 93. Old Pending Age Increasing

Check:

``` text
dead consumer
stuck processing
recovery worker
reclaim threshold
poison event
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 94. Reclaim Rate High

Check:

``` text
consumer instability
threshold too low
processing slowdown
node/pod churn
network failures
```

High reclaim rate is not normal success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 95. Retry Rate High

Check:

``` text
dependency outage
bad deployment
timeout settings
rate limiting
poison events
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 96. DLQ Growing

Group by:

``` text
failure class
event type
producer version
consumer version
```

Look for systemic patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 97. Duplicate Effects

Check:

``` text
ACK boundary
consumer crash
reclaim
idempotency race
dedupe retention
manual replay
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 98. Backlog Not Shrinking

Calculate:

``` text
consumer rate - producer rate
```

If result is zero or negative, catch-up is mathematically impossible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 99. Recovery Hurts Database

Reduce:

``` text
consumer replicas
concurrency
batch size
replay rate
```

Protect the database before accelerating backlog recovery.

## 110. Example

``` text
Normal:
P99 processing age < 30 seconds

Warning:

Critical:
oldest unprocessed age > 5 minutes
```

Thresholds must be derived from actual business requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 82 --- Recovery Readiness Review

How much backlog accumulates?
Can retention preserve it?
Can consumers catch up?
Can dependencies survive catch-up?
How are abandoned messages recovered?
How are poison events isolated?
Can DLQ be replayed safely?
How are duplicates prevented?
```

# 116. Key Takeaways

1.  The Pending Entries List is the center of consumer-group recovery.
2.  Pending work is not necessarily failed work.
3.  Reclaim only when work is genuinely abandoned.
4.  Reclaim thresholds must be based on measured processing latency.
5.  Premature reclaim can create concurrent duplicate processing.
6.  Retryable and non-retryable failures must be classified explicitly.
7.  Unknown failures should not retry forever.
8.  Retry attempts consume real capacity and can amplify outages.
9.  Use bounded retries with backoff and jitter.
10. Redis Streams do not automatically provide delayed retry scheduling.
11. Poison events must be isolated so healthy work can continue.
12. A DLQ requires monitoring, ownership, retention, and replay
    procedures.
13. Never blindly replay a large DLQ.
14. Preserve business event identity through retries and replay.
15. ACK does not eliminate duplicate-processing windows.
16. Idempotency is therefore fundamental.
17. Deduplication windows must cover realistic retry/replay horizons.
18. Consumer outages require explicit backlog and catch-up modeling.
19. Recovery throughput must exceed live producer throughput to catch
    up.
20. Recovery must be paced to protect downstream systems.
21. Lag SLOs should reflect business processing age, not only message
    counts.
22. Retention must support the maximum outage and catch-up objective.
23. Oldest pending age is a critical operational signal.
24. Reliability dashboards should correlate Streams with downstream
    dependency health.
25. Production readiness means proving crash, retry, poison-event,
    replay, outage, and catch-up behavior before an incident.
